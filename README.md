- 👋 Hi, I’m Dawid
- 👀 I’m interested in mathematics and numerical methods. 
I specialise in the theory of dynamical systems and I want to learn how to apply computer methods to obtain results in this field.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning and deep neural networks.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on numerical and symbolical analysis of mathematical models and data coming from them.
